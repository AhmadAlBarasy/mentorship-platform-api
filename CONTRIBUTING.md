# How to contribute?
It's actually simple, follow these steps:
---
* Fork this repository
* Create a new branch and use the kebab case naming convention
* if you're adding a new feature, start the name of the branch with the word: `feat`, if you're attempting to fix a bug, start with `bug`, if you're improving existing code, start with `impr`
* Use descriptive and concise naming for your branch

After you finish hacking, create a PR to the main branch of this repo, and then we can have a discussion and a code review together before PR approval
